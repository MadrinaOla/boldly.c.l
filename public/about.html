        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-left px-28">Boldly Courageous Life was born out of sheer necessity. That was a time in my life when I arrived at a place of knowing with certainty that there is more to life than my current state.  This is where I was in 2017 feeling frustrated and unfulfilled with my job, confused about what to do next, and fearful about moving on the decisions that were necessary to change my current state of misery. Can you relate?<br>
            <br>It was at my Mom’s funeral, that it suddenly hit me, that life is short, and life is only ever fulfilling when lived with integrity to our Authentic Selves. It became crystal clear that I was not fulfilled with the state of my employment, my social life was non–existent and I was showing up in my life, disempowered and de-energized! 
                It was time for a big change. It was time for me to show up as the Bold and Courageous me that I knew I was not honoring! That’s when I decided to get trained and become Certified as a Personal and Executive Life Coach with the CAPP Institute, a goal I achieved in 2018.<br>
            <br>Being trained as a Coach has opened new doors for me. It has enabled me to serve and support  women who find themselves at a crossroad in their careers, personal lives and any area of influence. They, like I was, know there is more to life, but they feel stuck and unsure how to make the shift into a life of meaning and purpose.<br>
            <br>Having worked for over 25 years in Clinical Pathology, in South Africa and the Washington DC metro area, as well as, in several states in North America; my training to explore, pinpoint, examine and diagnose a presenting pathology has proven beneficial to my Transformation Coaching work at Boldly Courageous Life.<br>
            <br>Coaching, if you will, requires the same attention-to-detail, and results-oriented model that needs me to be fully present with my clients; to focus microscopically on the underlying issue of the presenting symptoms, and to move together with my clients toward the best solutions.<br>
            <br>In my work, I delight in supporting, encouraging and empowering the client to determine a strategic plan of action which enables them to make the needed shift: from chaos to clarity, from perfectionism to progress and into a life that is in integrity with their Bold and Courageous selves.<br>
            <br>If my story resonates with you, please take a moment to contact me and see if I can support you by identifying and eliminating the blockers that are hindering you from living your life fully and with meaning and purpose.<br>
